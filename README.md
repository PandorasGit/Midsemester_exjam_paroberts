### Reflection

This project was a lot of fun. The game play is a lot simplier than some projects I've done before. This was because my main focus for this game was to experiment with as much juice as possible. This included learning the new tween system and making a lot more assets. Besides the lack luster spikes, I feel like this is my best looking game yet because of that. I feel like I could turn this project into a much larger "rage" style game and it be quite good in that genre.
